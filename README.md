# HoloBoard
HoloLens 3D whiteboard hologram.


# System requirements 
The Windows 10 SDK works best on the **Windows 10 operating system**. This SDK is also supported on Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2. Note that not all tools are supported on older operating systems. Visual Studio 2015 also has hardware requirements.

The HoloLens emulator is based on Hyper-V and uses RemoteFx for hardware accelerated graphics. To use the emulator, make sure your PC meets these hardware requirements:
- 64-bit Windows 10 Pro, Enterprise, or Education (The Home edition does not support Hyper-V. Installing the HoloLens Emulator will fail on the Home edition)
- 64-bit CPU
- CPU with 4 cores (or multiple CPU's with a total of 4 cores)
- 8 GB of RAM or more
- In the BIOS, the following features must be supported and enabled:â€¢Hardware-assisted virtualization
- Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)
- Hardware-based Data Execution Prevention (DEP)

- GPU (The emulator might work with an unsupported GPU, but will be significantly slower)
- DirectX 11.0 or later
- WDDM 1.2 driver or later

If your system meets the above requirements, please ensure that the "Hyper-V" feature has been enabled on your system through Control Panel -> Programs -> Programs and Features -> Turn Windows Features on or off -> ensure that "Hyper-V" is selected for the Emulator installation to be successful.
